As a programmer and a person who derives a lot of enjoyment from coding in Python (the 'high-levelness' of the language makes it so fun to me), I have a tendency to like to create my own programs when it seems like a task manageable.

In that regard did I create an overly simplistic autoclicker. Now just like my other tkinter project, I know that I could have likely very easily found an existing program that could do this, but I thought it'd be fun to create my own.

This program has an extremely specific purpose - if you arrived in this repo without knowing it, then it probably won't be of use to you.

It's designed to be an autoclicker for BlueStacks when I play *Choices: Stories You Play* on it. I have configured Bluestacks to automatically click an advancemenet region of the screen whenever space is pressed (through BStacks' internal keyboard controls UI). However, there is no function to automatically emulate continuous key pressing (autoclicking). So I decided to make my own. In TkInter.

After I accidentally lost my progress 13 chapters into *It Lives In The Woods*, I was bugged. Bugged enough that I wasn't about to manually go through all that shit again, but not bugged enough that I wasn't willing to find some way to automate the tedium.

GUI is really minimalistic. Just hold the CTRL button while it is active
